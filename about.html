        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoy many activities in my free time, when I'm not coding of course! Some of the things that I like to do in my down time are going to the gym and working out, watching TV shows, playing video games with my brother and friends, and exploring wherever I am. Lately in the gym I have been focusing on lifting weights and building my routine to match my long term goals. It is definitely a process but I love taking care of myself and maintaining my health through fitness. Some TV shows that I have been watching recently are 'To Your Eternity' and 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' which recently came out in live action on Netflix. The video games that I am playing now are Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, Battlefield 2042, and Epic Age (which is a phone game).

        <h2>Career History</h2>
        <p>
          I have worked many different jobs in my career history, the most recent being the Student Records Coordinator for the Irving Universal Technical Institute Campus. Before that I was working as a Court Judicial Assistant in the Criminal Unit of Fort Collins' Count and District Courts. The job I loved the most so far was working as a Teaching Assistant / Administrative assistant to the Director for Sierra School of Thompson, which was a Special Education School for kids with social and emotional disabilities. However, with all of that experience behind me, I am looking forward to learning the skills to start a career in Web Development and Software Engineering.

        <h2>Family Life</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up in Kingwood, Texas with my identical twin brother. We have a very loving set of parents who convinced us to move from Kingwood to Fort Collins, Colorado. We lived in Colorado for almost eight years before our parents once again convinced us to follow them back to Texas, where we ended up in Dallas, Texas. I get to see my parents frequently, and I talk to my brother almost every day when we play video games together with our friends at the ends of most nights.
